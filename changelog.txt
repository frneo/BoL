Script Name: Neo's Little Helper
Author: Neo
Version: 1.44
Revision Date: Aug 28, 2014
Purpose: Overhead hud-integrated cooldown tracker and general utility
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.44
						  - Fixed core to work with GARENA (version 4.14)
							as well as with other regions (version 4.15)
--------------------------------------------------------------		
Version 1.43
						  - Fixed HP Bar position formula for patch 4.15
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.42
						  - Updated to work with patch 4.15
							- Some minor modifications to cooldown tracker to
								improve readability
							- Updated champion sprites (new Shyvana and Vayne)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.41
						  - Removed "Unknown" text from wards when the owner
								wasn't detected
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4
						  Total revamp of wards algorithm:
							- Circles will now be colored acording to ward type
							- Will show enemy name where ward was placed
							- Improved VIPs wards detection with new packets
							- Added configurable button to remove a ward in
								case the script fails to remove it automatically.
								This can happen when the ward area is in FoW at
								the exact moment when the ward dies out. I could
								avoid this, but it would risk deleting wards
								that weren't actually destroyed. (default key =
								backspace)
							- You can now choose the quality of the wards drawing
								from the menu. If you have a slower computer, use
								lower quality settings
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.33
						- Found bug in wards algorithm, everything should be
							fine now. Preparing code for v1.4 with some
							new stuff. Let me know how it's working for you
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.32
						- Made encryption as light as possible. Should
							help A LOT with loading time.
						- Fixed issues with wards detection that came up
							after last hotfix
						- Wards being deleted when they weren't destroyed
							has been fixed
						- Improved wards detection
						- Now properly detects Pinks placed from FoW
--------------------------------------------------------------								
Version 1.31
						- Fixed a bug in wards detection algorithm	
--------------------------------------------------------------						
Version 1.3
						- Added horizontal "side" HUD
						- Added a safe check to connect/disconnect code			
						- Improved auto-update and sprite-update code to
						  increase stability
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.22
						- Improved death timer formula, should now be spot on
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21
						- Added improvised death timer, since BoL function
							is currently broken. Should work just fine now
						- Fixed (hopefully) bugsplat when updating script.
							This will only be working for updates AFTER this
							version, of course.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2
						- Added option to chose from the 3 overhead-hud themes
							without compromising performance
						- Fixed issue where wards would disappear out of nowhere
						
						VIP only:
						- Added disconnect/reconnect tracking exploit with
							option to print in chat when enemy disconnected or 
							reconnected. Will also show on side HUD when enemy
							is disconnected.					
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.1
						- Hellsing helped me get the actual position of the ward
							for those wards you only catch a glimpse of. So now
							you get the actual ward position instead of champion
							position. Credits go to Hellsing who found this
						- Fixed recall exploit, it was detecting TF Ult as recall,
						  thanks goes to Hellsing who found this out
						- Added Teleport warning (VIPs only), it will print in
							chat when an enemy used Teleport
						- Added Twisted Fate ult warning (VIPs only), it will 
							print in chat when an enemy TF used his ult
						- Rewrote a lot of stuff to improve performance
						- Reworked the entire user interface, improving
							visuals while still getting more performance							
						- Fixed some bugs				
						- New menu option to reset side HUD position						
						- Sprites were modified heavily, so please don't forget
							to update your sprites BEFORE updating the script
--------------------------------------------------------------							
Version 1.02
						- Added friendly team passive timer for Aatrox, 
							Anivia and Zac
						- Improved ward tracking algorithm, should minimize
							double-drawing of wards when they're placed in weird
							places
						- Added turret ranges drawing, code heavily based
							on Husky's Tower Range Indicator (no need to reinvent
							the wheel here), so KUDOS to him
--------------------------------------------------------------							
Version 1.01
						For everyone:
						- Improved general ward detection algorithm
						For VIPs only:
						- Added EXCLUSIVE option to track unknown wards: this means
							that you can track those wards that were placed
							close to your team from the FoW inside a bush or
							something. These objects will only show you
							a brief flash of light when they are placed.
							The actual item position isn't known, but
							the script will show you where the champion that placed
							the item was at the time, so you can known with very good
							precision where the item was probably placed.
							You can choose for how long	to display these items as well.
							I've never seen any script track these wards, so it's nice. :)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0 
						- Added Aatrox, Anivia and Zac passive cooldown tracker												
						- Added wards tracking, will show on map/minimap. This
							uses an advanced algorithm to actually detect properly
							which type of ward was created. This means that, when
							the packets for that ward weren't triggered (happens 
							when enemy places ward from FoW into friendly vision),
							it will actually be able to determine which ward was
							placed, to display the proper cooldown of that ward
						- Further improved the algorithm for overhead HUD position,
						  should now feel like its really part of the game HUD
						- Overhead HUD visuals improved to reflect these changes
							in the algorithm
						- Changed colors of spell-level sprites.
						- Changed alpha-level of side-HUD summoners cooldown pics
						- Added alternate, bigger, yet "more compact" over-head HUD 
						  skin/theme for who wanted a bigger HUD
						- Code optimization for performance. This does not
							mean the script is light. I does a lot of processing.
							If you have every feature ON, you might expect some FPS
							drop on SLOWER computers. I have a 3 year old processor
							and I'm fine using this with everything ON	
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.94
						- Added turrets health: won't be displayed if turret
						  has max health, to not polute the interface.
							Will be displayed in percentage, with dynamic colors
							according to health left. Will also display inhibitor
							and nexus health
						- Added inhibitors respawn timer. Default color is
							white, but can be changed from the menu
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.931
						- I decided to remove the "Trackeee" alternate design
							from the script. After thinking a lot about it, I
							don't really feel confortable having something here
							that I didn't design myself. Hope everyone understands
							how I feel and why I made this decision.
						- Changed the sprites loading/unloading option a bit
						  to see if that helps some users who are getting
							bugsplats on start						
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.93
						- Following up on some requests, I've added an alternate
							theme to the overhead HUD display, similar to what
							Trackee used to look like. The design is inspired by
							a picture someone showed me of Trackee, since I
							haven't had the chance to try it out myself.
							If Weee isn't OK with me using a similar design
							to his, I'll remove this option
						- Changed recall messages a bit, due to requests
						- Fixed an issue where things could break if you reloaded
							during an enemy recall
						- Sprites extraction code improved
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.92
						- Added option to update sprites from menu, in-game
						- Script will tell you if you need a sprites update
						- Huge upgrade in HUD drawing:
							- Sprites updated to improve both visuals and performance
							- Smoother drawing of overhead hud
							- Cool new formula I found should now make overhead hud
							  "stick" perfectly on healthbar
							- Optimized performance of hud displays
							- Changed writing colors a bit to improve recognition
							  of status
						- Code optimization, some functions rewritten from scratch
						- Got rid of annoying "Drag me" image. Now just hold shift
							and click wherever on the hud to move it
						VIP's only:
						- Now clicking on an enemy portrait on the side hud will
							ping (clientside) where that hero is (or was last seen)
						- Added detection of Recall channel time. So it will
							check if channel duration is 8 or 7 seconds for map
							Summoners Rift and 3.5 or 4 seconds for Dominion
						- Fix: now checks if map is Summoners Rift to display 
							jungle timers (will probably be removed in patch 4.12)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.91
						- Fixed issues for free users
						- Fixed a possible serialization bug
--------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9
						For everyone/free users:
						- Fixed error where hud position wasn't saving
						- Added more enemy information to side-hud
							(enemy missing, death timer)
						- Added hotkey to toggle side-hud on/off (default: Numpad0)
						For VIP's only:
						- Enemy recalling messages are now in a different color
						- Shows enemy hp in enemy recalling messages,
							hp will be green, yellow or red, according
							to percentage
						- Added customizable jungle timers 
						- Option to ping (clientside) before jungle spawns
						- Option to warn in chat(clientside) before jungle spawns
						- You can now send fully customizable jungle timer 
							messages to your team (default key: ~tilde).
							Just move your mouse over the camp in the minimap and
							press the custom key.
							You can set your personal msg in NeosLittleHelper.cfg
							inside Scripts/Common folder
